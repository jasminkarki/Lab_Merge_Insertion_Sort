Insertion Sort:
	Best Case: When all the elements are sorted.
	Worst Case: When all the elements are completely unsorted(in opposite direction).

Merge Sort:
	It uses divide and conquer algorithm and its [ Best Case= Worst Case= Average Case ]
	At each level of recursion, the merge process is performed on the entire array.
	Each level of recursion is O(n). There are O(log n) levels of recursion as array is approximately halved each time.
	So, mergesort takes just as long no matter what the existing state of the array. 


For a small number of elements, Insertion Sort has less time complexity and it is better.
but for a large number of elements, Merge Sort is better.
