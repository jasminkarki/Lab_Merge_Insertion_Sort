# Lab_Merge_Insertion_Sort
Lab Works done on 22 April

Solution to
1.Implement the following sorting algorithms:
  (a)  Insertion sort
  (b)  Merge sort
2.  Write some test cases to test your program.
3.  Generate some random inputs for your program and 
    apply both insertionsort  and  merge  sort  algorithms  to  sort  the  generated  sequence  of  data.
    Record the execution times of both algorithms for best and worst caseson inputs of different size.  
    Plot an input-size vs execution-time graph.
4.  Explain your observations.
